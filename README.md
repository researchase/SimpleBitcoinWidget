SimpleBitcoinWidget
===================

Android widget that displays Bitcoin value using Coinbase API

This widget registers a service that polls https://coinbase.com/api/v1/prices/spot_rate to get current bitcoin rate every 30 minutes. This is a simple project I did to learn more about Android services and widgets.
